Dexterous manipulation capabilities of end-effectors afford us a wide range of strategies for fine-grained manipulation tasks. Recent utilization of readily available materials like soft filaments and silicone elastomers has enabled the development of low-cost mechanically intelligent robotic manipulators. This is important for democratizing robot manipulation and increasing accessibility in robotics. However, these robots generally have complex non-linear dynamics that are hard to model analytically, and even harder to learn numerically in the real world in a sample efficient manner. Towards these challenges, we propose a novel manipulator for exploring the capabilities of a complex multi-robot dexterous manipulation system and accessible hardware that can leverage these algorithms to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

We present an array of 64 linear soft delta robots in an 8x8 hexagonal grid, for the development of new manipulation paradigms that can learn complex prehensile and non-prehensile skills in the real world. The 3D-printed soft TPU links provide mechanical compliance and allow collisions without harming the end-effector. We demonstrate dexterous manipulation capabilities of the delta array using reinforcement learning while leveraging the compliance to not break the end-effectors. Our evaluations show that the resulting 192 DoF-compliant robot is capable of performing various coordinated distributed manipulations of a variety of objects, including translation, alignment, prehensile squeezing, lifting, and grasping.

In an autonomous deployment, robots will need perceive their own state (proprioception) and the surrounding environment (exteroception) to make minor adjustments to their leg or wing trajectories or perform higher-level switching between task-specific behaviors. My group is currently classifying a number of mm-scale sensors based on their accuracy, resolution, and bandwidth, as well as their size, weight, and power consumption to develop a database of suitable sensing, processing, and power systems.

We have integrated mm-scale COTS IMUs, ToF sensors, and high-resolution vision systems on the RoboBee platform, demonstrating controlled flights with onboard sensing systems.

DeltaHand is a synergistic robotic hand platform for dexterous manipulation. By leveraging the modularity of Delta robots, our hands are easy to configure to different degrees of freedom with actuation synergies. The manufacturing is low cost by using off-the-shelf materials (the robot can be manufactured in less than a day and costs under $800). We use soft Delta links for the fingers, and show that our hands can compliantly and safely interact with the environment. 

We demonstrate grasping of daily objects using our hand prototypes and teleoperating a 9-actuator Delta hand with a Franka robot arm for dexterous manipulation tasks, we show that we can easily control our hands by leveraging the synergy of our hands while maintaining the necessary dexterity.
